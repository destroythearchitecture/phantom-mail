# Phantom Mail

A Haraka mail plugin which simply compresses and encrypts emails using PGP (including all metadata) and saves them into a directory.
Delivery of these encrypted files should be done through a secure side-channel and NOT via IMAP, TLS or not, there will be another tool for this.

Initial Prototype.
